/**
 * @module edge-orphans.service
 *
 * The I/O half of the edge-orphan sweep: read what the local edge serves, read
 * what Openship tracks, and hand both to the pure diff in `@repo/core`.
 *
 * Why an orphan exists at all — record-only delete ("Remove from Openship only")
 * promises the workload keeps running, which explicitly includes NOT removing the
 * route. So the vhost outlives its DB rows by design. A port-based leftover 502s
 * and announces itself; a STATIC leftover keeps serving the old project's files
 * with a 200, on a hostname that may since have been handed to someone else, and
 * nothing looked for it.
 *
 * Read-only except for `removeEdgeOrphan`, which takes ONE named hostname. There
 * is deliberately no sweep-and-delete: that would break the guarantee that
 * created the orphan in the first place.
