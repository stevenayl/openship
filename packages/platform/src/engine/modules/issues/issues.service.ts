 * @module issues
 *
 * "What is wrong across this whole installation right now, and what do I click?"
 *
 * Openship already detected every one of these conditions — it just answered the
 * question one surface at a time. A crash loop lived on its project's Health tab,
 * an unreachable box only ever reached a notification channel, a broken cert sat on
 * a domain row, and edge/mail state made it to the home card. An operator with a
 * dozen boxes had nowhere that listed all of it, which is the difference between
 * "monitoring exists" and "I can see my fleet".
 *
 * So this module adds NO detection. It is a read-only aggregator over five readers
 * that already exist and already own their facts:
 *
 *   repos.serviceIncident.listByOrg   workload + server incidents (the only source
 *                                     with a lifecycle, so the only one with history)
 *   loadOrgContainerIssues            edge / mail component state (cached rows)
 *   getOrgPendingActions              deploy / routing / port / domain / SSL
 *   listOrganizationUpdates           project version drift (advisory)
 *   listBehindByOrg                   managed edge/mail image drift (advisory)
 *
 * The rules that keep it from becoming a fifth source of truth:
 *   - it never writes, never probes, and never re-implements a verdict. Freshness
 *     is each source's own business — `listOrganizationUpdates` polls what its
 *     cache can't answer, precisely so this module never has to ask whether the
 *     row it just read was real.
 *   - severity is defined ONCE, in `SEVERITY_RANK` below. Pending actions map their
 *     existing tier straight through rather than being re-judged.
 *   - every item carries its fix as data — `resolveWith` (an HTTP call) for
 *     project/domain items, `infraFix` (a modal flow) for managed containers —
 *     so no caller has to know which endpoint answers which condition.
