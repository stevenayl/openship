/**
 * THE channel for "is anything out of date?" across every updatable entity — and
 * every entity is a project row (git projects, release/dist projects, the
 * self-app, webmail, installed template apps). The project page's banner, the
 * Apps tab, the home card and the issues feed all come through here, so they
 * cannot disagree about the same project.
 *
 * What is cached, and what is not:
 *
 *   `update_status` caches the UPSTREAM half of drift only — the branch HEAD, the
 *   newest release tag, the registry digest per service. That half costs a
 *   network round-trip per project and no local event announces when it moves, so
 *   it can only be polled.
 *
 *   The DEPLOYED half — what's actually running — is read live on every request.
 *   It's a local row lookup, and it is written by seven different code paths
 *   (deploy success, rollback, reconcile, activate, clear, self-deploy, migrate).
 *   Caching it meant every one of those needed an invalidation hook, and a missed
 *   hook left an operator staring at "update available" for a commit they had
 *   already shipped. Deriving it removes the hook requirement entirely.
 *
 * So `behind`, `latestInProgress` and both display labels are COMPUTED on read
 * (`evaluateDrift`), never stored.
 *
 * The cache is READ-THROUGH, and that is not an optimisation detail — it is what
 * makes the answer trustworthy. Enumerating cached ROWS meant a project nobody had
 * polled yet was indistinguishable from a project that was up to date, so the
 * issues feed said "nothing needs attention" while the same project's own page
 * showed a new commit. It now enumerates PROJECTS and treats a missing, expired or
 * no-longer-matching row as a question to answer, not as a "no". "Nothing needs
 * attention" is only ever printed after looking.
 *
 * Every poll — wherever it starts, including the project page's own banner — is
 * written back, so the surface an operator visits warms the surface they don't.
 * `updates:scan` is therefore a warm-up, not the only writer: the tracker is
 * correct on a cold cache, on desktop (where the job never runs at all), and on an
 * instance whose scheduler is broken.
