/**
 * MigrationOrchestrator — drives a full Docker migration:
 *
 *   adopt  → create the Openship `services` project from the selected stack
 *   moving_data → quiesce (stop) the originals on the source; for a
 *                 cross-server move, stream each named volume AND app-data bind
 *                 mount A→B directly
 *                 (executor.streamPath → executor.receiveStream; same sourceId
 *                 both sides, so the target volume — bare-named because adopt
 *                 keeps namespaceVolumes=false — is populated with no remap)
 *   deploying → deploy the adopted project on the target server
 *   verifying → wait for the target deployment to reach `ready`
 *   awaiting_cutover → success; wait for the user to confirm the destructive
 *                 teardown of the originals — OR keep, which (cross-server)
 *                 RESTARTS the quiesced originals so the old server runs as a
 *                 live standby. Same-server keep leaves them stopped (the target
 *                 now holds their ports/volumes).
 *   cutover → stop + remove the originals on the source (by scanned container
 *             id — they carry no openship.* labels). Never removes A volumes.
 *   rolled_back → any pre-cutover failure: tear down the target deployment and
 *                 restart the originals on the source. Never destroys A.
 *
 * A dedicated FSM (not the backup/restore orchestrators) because the source has
 * no Openship deployment to resolve an executor from, the target is
 * container-less pre-deploy, and we require no configured backup destination.
