/**
 * Drift — "is what's running behind what the source offers?" — has two halves,
 * and they have nothing in common but the comparison:
 *
 *   UPSTREAM ("what does the source offer?")  network. GitHub branch HEAD, the
 *     newest release tag, a registry digest per service. Rate-limited, slow, and
 *     no local event tells us when it changes — it can only be POLLED, which is
 *     why `update_status` caches it and `updates:scan` refreshes it.
 *
 *   DEPLOYED ("what is actually running?")  local. The active deployment's row.
 *     Free to read, and mutated by seven different code paths (deploy success,
 *     rollback, reconcile, activate, clear, self-deploy, migrate).
 *
 * Only the upstream half is cached. Caching the deployed half is what produced
 * "update available a1b2c3d → e4f5g6h" on a project whose deployment list showed
 * it shipped e4f5g6h days earlier: the row froze mid-window, and of the seven
 * writers only one could ever have invalidated it. Deriving it on read makes
 * that whole class of staleness unrepresentable — no invalidation hook to
 * forget, because there is nothing local left to invalidate.
 *
 * The upstream half is cached UNDER THE SOURCE IDENTITY it was polled for — a
 * branch key, a release-source key, an image ref. Change the branch or the tag
 * and the cached answer stops matching the question (`upstreamMatchesSource`),
 * so the reader re-polls instead of comparing against another source's HEAD.
 * That's why editing a project's source needs no invalidation call: a cache keyed
 * by what it describes cannot be asked the wrong question.
 *
 * So: `resolveUpstreamDrift` (cache this) + `resolveDeployedDrift` (never cache)
 * + `evaluateDrift` (compare). This module owns the three primitives and knows
 * nothing about the cache; `updates.service` owns the storage and the freshness
 * policy, and is the one place any surface asks "is this project behind?".
