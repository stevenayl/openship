 *
 * Two classes of target are refused rather than attempted:
 * - A **missing** container — recreating it needs the secrets its setup path owns.
 * - An **edge whose box isn't clean** on 80/443. This path has no `promptUser` (a
 *   bulk run must never block on a modal), so `ensureEdgeClear` would refuse with
 *   `EdgeConflictError`. The apply now reports that refusal as a failure rather than
 *   swallowing it — but a target we KNOW would refuse shouldn't be promised in the
 *   first place, so it's pre-probed and handed back to the per-server page, where the
 *   takeover consent prompt actually exists.
 *
 * Returns as soon as the targets are classified: the applies run detached through
 * `runContainerApply`, so each one is a replayable session the operator can click
 * into for live logs, and `latestInProgress` already renders as "Updating…".
