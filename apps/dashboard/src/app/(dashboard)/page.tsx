/**
 * The dashboard home, per product view.
 *
 * In Openship Mail this IS the mail console — the server list, or the scoped
 * server, whichever `resolveMailView()` picks. Rendered, not redirected: the URL
 * stays `/`, which is where login lands, so a mail operator never sees the URL
 * bounce to /emails?serverId=… on every visit and never lands on a dashboard of
 * projects they do not keep.
 *
 * Why the branch is here and not a rewrite in next.config.mjs or src/proxy.ts:
 * both of those see only the `openship-product-view` cookie, and mail mode is
 * just as often the instance-wide default (`instance_settings.product_mode`, read
 * over the API) with no cookie set at all — a cookie-gated rewrite would send
 * every fresh browser on a mail box to the platform home. This resolves through
 * the same `resolveRequestProductView()` the layout uses, so the rail and the
 * page cannot disagree about which product is on screen.
 *
 * It also means `projects/home` is never fetched in mail view. The platform's
 * home payload (projects, deployments, activity) is work no one asked for on a
 * box whose rail has no projects page.
