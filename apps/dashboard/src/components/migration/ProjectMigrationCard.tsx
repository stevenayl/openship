/**
 * Move this project to another server — the BODY of the Advanced tab's Migration card.
 *
 * Body only, not the card: the surrounding chrome is `AdvancedSettings`' own `SectionCard`,
 * so this sits in the same bordered, titled box as Project Status and Routing rather than
 * inventing a second card style next to them.
 *
 * It lives in a COLLAPSED full-width section, which is what lets the whole decision —
 * from, to, move-or-duplicate, and (for a duplicate) which services — sit on one line
 * instead of stacking into a column the operator scrolls.
 *
 * The flow is deliberately short: choose, confirm, and you are IN the migration session.
 *
 * The confirm dialog is local — it restates the choice and the two things a run cannot fix
 * (downtime, and DNS still pointing at the old host) from what is already on screen. It does
 * not plan. Planning means an SSH scan of the source, which is seconds of work that can fail
 * on an unreachable host, and doing it before the operator has even agreed put a whole
 * waiting flow in front of the flow that already exists. It now happens in the run's
 * `adopting` phase, where its progress and any failure land in the session's own log and the
 * run is retryable and resumable.
 *
 * Progress is NOT here. Starting hands the run id up via {@link onStarted} and the parent
 * swaps in the ordinary migration run panel — the same one the server's Migrations tab opens
 * a row into. There is no project-specific progress, log, cutover or rollback UI.
