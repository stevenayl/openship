/**
 * "Where to install" picker for the app wizards. Exactly two kinds of destination:
 * a SERVER ROW (the shared mail-style `ServerSelector` dropdown — pre-selects the
 * first/only server so the wizard opens with a destination already chosen,
 * collapses many into a searchable list, carries its own "add server") or Openship
 * Cloud. Reports the pick as `{deployTarget, serverId, serverHost}`.
 *
 * The selector is a PEER radio option here, not a fixed header: passing an
 * explicit `null` while cloud is active is what makes it render unselected and
 * clickable again, so the choice stays two-way on a one-server box.
 *
 * THE OPENSHIP HOST IS A SERVER ROW, never a separate "this machine" card. On a
 * server-host install the box registers itself as the `isLocal` "This Server" row
 * (startup/self-server.ts) and appears in the selector above, so a second card for
 * the same machine was not just redundant — it resolved to the same platform
 * (`resolveTargetPlatform` builds an identical selfhosted/socket/`provision:local`
 * target either way) while losing the server's `sshHost`, which is what makes a
 * port-only install's URL reachable. Picking it on a VPS yielded
 * `http://localhost:<port>`, useless from anywhere but the box itself.
 *
 * That rule is now unconditional, which also makes this agree with the MAIN deploy
 * wizard — `useDesktopTargets` offers servers + cloud and no local card, on every
 * mode including desktop. Two pickers for the same question should not disagree
 * about what a destination is.
